Lazy Loading in Entity Framework Core
- Lazy loading is the process whereby an entity or collection of entities is automatically loaded from the database the first time that a property referring to the entity/entities is accessed. When using Entity Framework Core, lazy loading is achieved by using the virtual keyword on a navigation property.

Relationships:

- A "User" can have multiple "Reviews" (1:N)
- A "Book" can have multiple "Reviews" (1:N)
- A "Publisher" can have multiple "Books" (1:N)
- A "Subject" can have multiple "Books" (1:N)
- Books and Authors have a many-to-many relationship mediated by the "BookAuthor" table
